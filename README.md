- The system will authorize the user's credit card when they place an order based on the maximum rate of the items they are ordering, assuming they will not get their quantity/group buying discounts.  When the group closes, the system will settle the amount due based on the final price.  Suppose the user buys multiple types of products in a single transaction. In that case, the system will have to do a separate auth for each item because each group can close at a different time and therefore has to be settled separately. - Groups can auto-renew, which means that the next group will be ready for ordering before the current one finishes. Once a group for a product is completed, the next one in the queue automatically gets turned on. Typically, the period of a group will be 1-week, but the system will allow different values for different groups. - After a group sale is complete, the system settles all the CC charges and collects the money. The admin will disburse the funds to the supplier manually via ACH or check after deducting commissions. The platform will generate a report that will determine commissions and manual payment amounts to the suppliers.
